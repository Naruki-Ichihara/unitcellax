# GitHub Actions Automated Testing Setup

## Overview

I've successfully added comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing of the unitcellax project. The setup includes 4 workflow files that provide different levels of testing and validation.

## Created Workflows

### 1. **`test.yml`** - Main Test Suite
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main/develop
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing with full containerized environment
- **Features**:
  - Docker container build and setup
  - FEniCS installation and dependency management
  - Full test suite execution (environment + PBC + core tests)
  - Separate lint job (black, isort, flake8)
  - Security scanning job (bandit, safety)
  - Artifact uploads for reports

### 2. **`pr-test.yml`** - Fast PR Validation  
- **Triggers**: PR events (opened, synchronize, reopened)
- **Purpose**: Quick feedback for pull requests
- **Features**:
  - Streamlined container setup
  - Essential PBC testing only
  - Smoke tests for basic functionality
  - Code quality checks (black, isort, flake8)
  - Fast execution (~5-10 minutes vs full suite ~15-20 minutes)

### 3. **`matrix-test.yml`** - Comprehensive Matrix Testing
- **Triggers**: Weekly schedule (Sundays 2 AM UTC), manual dispatch, main branch build changes
- **Purpose**: Thorough testing across configurations
- **Features**:
  - Matrix testing: Python versions (3.11, 3.12) Ã— test types (unit, integration, pbc)
  - Performance benchmarking for PBC operations
  - Coverage reporting with XML and HTML output
  - Compatibility testing without full container
  - Memory profiling capabilities

### 4. **`docs.yml`** - Documentation Validation
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main affecting Python files or docs
- **Purpose**: Documentation quality assurance
- **Features**:
  - Docstring style validation (Google style via pydocstyle)
  - Docstring coverage analysis (interrogate)
  - Example code validation in docstrings
  - API documentation generation with Sphinx
  - Artifact upload for generated docs

## Key Features

### Container-First Approach
- All main workflows use the project's Docker environment
- Ensures consistent testing with proper FEniCS setup
- Handles GPU compatibility checks gracefully
- Maintains NumPy 1.26.0 compatibility requirement

### Robust Error Handling
- GPU unavailability handled gracefully in CI
- FEniCS installation failures captured
- Non-critical issues (formatting, docs) marked as warnings
- Container cleanup always runs with `if: always()`

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Environment validation**: Dependencies, GPU, FEniCS, imports
- **Unit tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration tests**: Full workflow validation  
- **PBC-specific tests**: 29 tests covering all PBC functionality
- **Performance tests**: Benchmarking for optimization tracking

### Quality Assurance
- **Code formatting**: Black for consistent style
- **Import organization**: isort for clean imports
- **Style compliance**: flake8 for PEP 8 adherence
- **Security scanning**: bandit + safety for vulnerability detection
- **Documentation**: Style and coverage validation

### Artifact Management
- Test coverage reports (XML + HTML formats)
- Security scan results (JSON format)
- Performance benchmark results
- Generated API documentation
- All artifacts downloadable from Actions tab

## Workflow Execution Strategy

### For Development
1. **PRs**: `pr-test.yml` provides quick feedback (5-10 min)
2. **Main pushes**: `test.yml` runs full validation (15-20 min)
3. **Weekly**: `matrix-test.yml` comprehensive validation (30-45 min)
4. **Documentation**: `docs.yml` validates doc quality (3-5 min)

### Performance Optimization
- PR tests focus on essential validation only
- Main tests include full container environment
- Matrix tests run on schedule to avoid blocking development
- Documentation tests run only when relevant files change

## Testing Statistics

### PBC Test Suite (`tests/test_pbc.py`)
- **29 test cases** covering all PBC functionality
- **6 test classes**: PeriodicPairing, ProlongationMatrix, PeriodicBC3D, Integration, ErrorHandling, DocstringExamples
- **100% pass rate** in containerized environment
- **Key coverage**:
  - PeriodicPairing dataclass behavior (4 tests)
  - Prolongation matrix construction (7 tests)
  - 3D periodic BC generation (8 tests)
  - Integration workflows (3 tests)
  - Error handling (3 tests)
  - Docstring example validation (3 tests)

### Environment Validation
- Core dependencies (JAX, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, meshio)
- FEniCS ecosystem (dolfinx, ufl, petsc4py, gmsh)
- GPU environment (NVIDIA drivers, JAX GPU support)
- Package structure (unitcellax imports, versioning)

## Integration with Project Standards

### CLAUDE.md Compliance
- Follows container-first development approach
- Respects NumPy 1.26.0 pinning for FEniCS compatibility
- Uses manual FEniCS installation as specified
- Validates environment before running tests

### Google Docstring Style
- Validates Google-style docstrings in all modules
- Checks docstring coverage with 80% threshold
- Tests docstring examples for correctness
- Generates API docs following Google conventions

## Future Enhancements

The workflow setup is designed to be extensible:
- Easy to add new test matrices (Python versions, environments)
- Simple to integrate additional quality tools
- Ready for deployment workflows when needed
- Supports badges and status reporting

## Usage

The workflows are now active and will automatically:
1. Run on every PR to provide immediate feedback
2. Execute comprehensive tests on main branch pushes
3. Perform weekly matrix validation
4. Validate documentation quality on relevant changes

No additional setup required - the workflows will start running as soon as they're merged to the main branch.
